# COVID-19 Dashboard Project (Tableau)

This project presents an interactive COVID-19 dashboard built using **Tableau**, based on cleaned and prepared data from two Excel files:

- **COVID Deaths**: Contains data on cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and population.
- **COVID Vaccinations**: Includes vaccination rates, testing data, and demographic indicators.

## Data Preparation

I first imported the raw data into **SQL**, ran several queries to extract and join key information, and then exported the cleaned datasets to Excel. This allowed me to focus on relevant metrics for visualization and analysis.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides a clear view of the global COVID-19 situation with the following sections:

- **Global Numbers**: Shows total cases, total deaths, and death percentage worldwide.
- **Percent Population Infected Per Country**: An interactive map to compare infection rates across countries.
- **Total Deaths Per Country**: Highlights the countries with the highest number of deaths.
- **Percent Population Infected**: Displays infection rate per country relative to population size.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data cleaning and preparation
- **Excel**: For storing and organizing the query results
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations and building the dashboard

## Goal

The goal of this project is to make complex COVID-19 data more accessible and easy to explore, helping users identify trends and compare the pandemic's impact across countries.
